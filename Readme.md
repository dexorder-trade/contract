# Overview

These contracts power [â¬†dexorder](https://dexorder.trade).

The heart of the system is contained in `OrderLib.sol`, particularly the `OrderLib.execute()` method. `Vaults` are 
basically thin wrappers around the `OrderLib`.


# Quickstart

The development environment is based on [Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh) toolset.

```bash
sudo apt install make curl jq
curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash  # Foundry
cp foundry-default.toml foundry.toml  # edit to include your own RPC URLs
bin/build
```


# Development

## Error Codes

All Dexorder error codes, along with a few error codes from Uniswap, are described in `doc/errors.md`.

## Mock Environment

run `bin/mock` to spin up an Anvil node which forks Arbitrum in order to have the Uniswap v3 contracts available,
deploys the essential Dexorder init contracts, and also deploys the `MockEnv` class, which contains two mock tokens 
MEH and USXD along with a mock pool to trade that pair. See `test/MockEnv.sol`.


### Mock Shell

Source `. bin/shmockenv` to populate these environment variables:

| Variable    | Description                                                                                |
|-------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `MOCK`      | Address of the MockEnv                                                                     |
| `MEH`       | Address of MEH token                                                                       |
| `USXD`      | Address of the USXD token                                                                  |
| `POOL`      | Address of the MEH/USXD pool                                                               |
| `T0`        | Address of token0 in the mock pool                                                         |
| `T1`        | Address of token1 in the mock pool                                                         |
| `INVERTED`  | True iff USXD is token 0 and MEH is token 1 (USXD/MEH) instead of the other way (MEH/USXD) |
| `MIRRORENV` | Address of the MirrorEnv (if deployed)                                                     |

There are also a few scripts available to manipulate the MockEnv:

`bin/price` shows the price of the mock MEH/USXD pool.  
NOTE: this price is always expressed as MEH/USXD regardless of the order of those two tokens in the mock pool.

`bin/setprice <number>` adjusts the price of the mock pool by minting new tokens and swapping them.  
NOTE: this sets the price of MEH in terms of USXD regardless of whether the pool is inverted.

## Deployments

Solidity compiler output and Foundry broadcast files for each chain are found under deployment/*<tag>*. The `broadcast`
directory contains files describing the deployment of the initial contracts on-chain, while the `out` directory
contains the usual solc compiler output including ABI information.

## Create a New Vault

To deploy a new Vault, use the `IVaultDeployer` interface, which is a superclass of Factory. You may find the factory
address in `contract/deployment/<tag>/broadcast/Deploy.sol/<chainId>/run-latest.json`.

```solidity
IVaultFactory factory = IVaultFactory(factoryAddress);
IVault myVault = factory.deployVault(); // deploy a vault owned by this smart contract
IVault yourVault = factory.deployVault(ownerAddress);  // deploy a vault owned by another account
```

Only a single vault per account address, vault number 0, is currently supported. Do not use vault numbers other than 0
until multi-vault support is added to the activation backend.

Any account may deploy the Vault associated with any given owner. That is, the owner of the vault does not need to be
its deployer. Vault addresses are deterministic and salted with the owner's address, so an account's associated Vault 
address may be computed off-chain, or by using the `VaultAddress` class. The `VaultAddress.sol` file is generated using 
the `bin/build` script for local builds, or use the deployed code from `deployments/.../VaultAddress.json`.

## Place an Order

For interaction with a Vault, use the `IVault` interface.

See `test/TestOrder.sol` for a couple simple examples of constructing an order that may be passed to the vault's
`placeOrder()` method.  Extensive documentation of the order spec is forthcoming...

The Dexorder backend detects and executes all placed orders from on-chain event data. There is no requirement to use the
Dexorder website to place orders. However, only the owner of a vault may place or cancel the orders in that vault. The
`placeOrder()` transaction must be signed by the vault's owner.

## Withdraw Funds

Standard `withdraw()` and `withdrawTo()` methods for both native coin and ERC20 tokens are available on the `IVault`
interface. Withdrawal transactions must be signed by the vault's owner.


# Security Notes

The Vault itself is a proxy contract that points its external methods to a shared VaultImpl contract, which is
basically an instantiation of the OrderLib. This tremendously reduces the size of the deployed vault instances and also
allows for a smoother user experience when upgrading to new versions. Any change to a vault's delegate implementation
contract requires an approval signature from the vault owner.

Overflow checking is now built-in to Solidity 0.8.x. We have *copied* Uniswap dependencies into our
repository and modified them to build with 0.8.

Vaults have re-entrancy locks.

`onlyOwner` modifiers guard order interactions and withdrawals.

The `kill()` mechanism only stops proxied methods, but methods directly on Vault, notably the `withdraw()` methods,
are always avaiable even after a kill switch.

The `execute()` method is intentionally public. It is expected to revert if any test of the order conditions fails.
